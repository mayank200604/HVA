## Implementation Notes for RAG System

### Profile Detection:
The system should ask clarifying questions to identify which profiles apply:
- "How many internships have you completed?"
- "What is your current CGPA?"
- "Which programming concepts do you find most challenging?"
- "Are you clear about your career direction, or still exploring?"

### Rule Triggering:
Based on detected profiles, trigger relevant guidance rules and resources

### Personalization:
Allow multiple profiles to apply simultaneously (e.g., Advanced + Weak in System Design)

### Iterative Refinement:
Students can respecify profiles as circumstances change
